`@casablanca-css/core` is framework agnostic CSS-in-JS library built for Vite.

* All styles are extracted to virtual CSS Modules, and no JS runtime is required.
* Just add a plugin in `vite.config.ts` . No additional config is required.
* Works with SPA, MPA, SSR, Dev server etc. See [examples](https://github.com/tkamenoko/casablanca-css/tree/main/examples).
